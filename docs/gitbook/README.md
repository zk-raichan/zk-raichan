# Introduction: Welcome to ZK-RAICHAN

ZK-RAICHAN is an open-source privacy protocol for Solana blockchain with **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** built in. Using a command line interface (CLI) dashboard, ZK-RAICHAN enables shielding, private transfers, mixing, and bridging of SPL tokens and SOL with complete anonymity.

**Navigation in ZK-RAICHAN CLI is performed through keyboard actions and terminal commands for maximum privacy and control.**

**Zero-Knowledge Proofs** powered by Light Protocol enable private transactions on Solana without revealing sender, receiver, or amount information on-chain.

ZK-RAICHAN provides complete privacy infrastructure for Solana users:

- **Public Address** - Standard Solana address where activity and balances are visible on-chain. Same as any regular Solana wallet.

- **Shielded Address** - ZK private address where activity and balances are completely hidden. Funds must be shielded to use private features.
